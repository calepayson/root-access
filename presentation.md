## Farmers Over-Apply Inputs

- 40% of water used in agriculture is lost to the environment
- 65% of applied nitrogen is not used by crops

---

## Farmers Can't Tolerate Risk

Missing a single application means crops die

Dead crops = tons of cost but no revenue **for the whole year**

---

## Existing Plant-Stress Indicators are Flawed

**NDVI** and **SIF** can't help farmers

- NDVI isn't real
- SIF is infrequently measured and a lagging indicator

---

## Use ML to Predict Stress

- Feed open-source data into an ML model
- Train the model to predict SIF values
